Exp 01 -

Using stable diffusion 1.5 instead of 2.1 to generate eyes open/close images

Prompt - 
For eyes closed - Face of a {race} {gender} with eyes closed
For eyes open - Face of a {race} {gender}
Negative prompt - "animated, cartoon, sketch, painting"

Observation - 
Even this model struggles with asian eyes similar to SD 2.1
Some races like indian are represented better and more realistic
Overall better quality, realistic images
Quite less hallucination compared to 2.1

Exp 02 -
Using SD 1.5 to generate images of face wearing glasses

Prompts - 
Face of a person with specular reflection on glasses
	Face of a person with reflection on glasses
	Face of a person with haze on glasses
	Face of a person with reflection off computer screen on glasses
Negative prompt - "animated, cartoon, sketch, painting"

Observation - 
1. Stable diffusion 1.5 generating good images with glasses
2. It is hallucinating for glaze on glasses
3. Struggling with reflection on glasses
4. There are 2 to 4 good images out of 80 for glaze

Exp 03 -
Using SD 1.5 to generate image of people with one eye closed 

Prompts -
	Face of a person with one eye closed
	Face of a {race} {gender} winking

Observations-
Model generated both eye closed images 



Exp 04 -
Using SD 1.5 to generate bad eye quality images

Prompts - 
	Face of a person with dark shadow on eyes
